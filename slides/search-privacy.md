Note:

Google, Facebook, and plenty of others make their money through ads. The more they know about you, the more accurately they can target these ads.

This is really valuable to advertisers, so they're willing to pay more to know they're reaching their intended audiences.

It's in the best interest of these services to build as detailed a profile of you as possible; every search on Google gives them a little more insight into what your interests or opinions are. They can use that to better-target ads at you.
