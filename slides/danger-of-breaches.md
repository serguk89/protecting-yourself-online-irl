### The Danger of Breaches

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Tim uses the same password everywhere
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Youth football league's website gets hacked
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Now, the bad guys have a working email/password combination ðŸ˜±

Note:

Let's imagine a boy named Tim, who uses the same password for everything.

Tim plays football, and his youth league has a forum where he and his teammates chat.

One day, that website gets breached, and bad guys steal a copy of the database. Passwords weren't being stored correctly (very common), so they can get to the passwords easily.

Now they try these combinations everywhere: social media, bank logins, email accounts, etc. Email is especially dangerous!
