### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Using public information to collect intelligence

Note:

There's a ton of information about us out there, and a lot of it's available for free with just a Google search.

By themselves, these little facts might not mean much, but put together they form a better picture of who we are, how we behave, and what valuables we might have.
