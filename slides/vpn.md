Note:

Invest in a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which secures all of the traffic coming from your device.

VPNs can also be used to mask where your traffic is coming from; I live in Columbus, but I'll typically route through Chicago, New York, or Washington, D.C.
- Can sometimes be used to get around country restrictions

Important to use a VPN service you trust. Running a VPN costs money, so be suspect of free VPN services
- May inject ads, track you, or worse!
- Work/school VPNs are meant to protect the company, not you. Expect that all traffic will be monitored.
