Note:

Short Message Service (SMS), a.k.a. text messaging is very popular, but it's built on a very old system: Signaling System Number 7 (SS7).
- Developed in 1975

Responsible for routing calls and texts; attackers could intercept calls and/or make it look like they're calling from a legitimate number.

SIM-jacking: Not super difficult to pose as the owner (or family of the owner) to get a new SIM card for a "lost" phone. Suddenly, the attacker can receive text messages sent to your number.
