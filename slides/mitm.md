### ðŸ˜ˆ Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

An attack vector where someone intercepts â€”Â and possibly modifies â€”Â communications.

Note:

Imagine sending a text message, but imagine someone else is receiving them all first and then forwarding them along. They could change anything along the way, or at the very least be listening to everything that's said.
