* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Over the phone
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> In-person

Note:

Social Engineering is an umbrella term, and can be utilized in a lot of different ways.

Maybe it's sending an official-looking email, or spoofing a text from someone's boss. Maybe it's a phone call, taking advantage of someone who is just trying to be helpful.

Dressing the part and acting like you belong can also go a long way towards making people trust you.
