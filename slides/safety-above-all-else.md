### Remember: Safety Above All Else

Things can be replaced, but you can't.

Note:

Finally, remember that if you're in public and somebody steals something, you're safety is the most important thing.

Phones, tablets, computers, and things can be replaced, and no Earthly possession is worth risking your safety for.
