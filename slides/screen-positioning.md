### Positioning

Note:

Try to find seats where nobody can get behind you and see your screen or keyboard

Use headphones for conversations, and consider anything you say in a public place will likely be overheard.

Back to the wall is the safest position. You can also get privacy filters for most devices, making it much harder to read from an angle.
