### Multi-factor Authentication

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Username, password, and generated access code
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> "Something you know + something you have"
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> SMS is insecure!

Note:

Two-factor or multi-factor authentication means you enter your username and password, then a one-time password (OTP).

OTP might be from authentication app (Google Authenticator, Duo, Authy, et al) or via email/text; idea is that even if your account details are compromised, attackers can't get in.

Many services still use codes sent via text messages, which are better than nothing but not secure!
