### Multi-factor Authentication

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Username, password, and generated access code
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> "Something you know + something you have"
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> SMS is insecure!

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 1Password, Google Authenticator, Duo, Authy

Note:

Two-factor or multi-factor authentication means you enter your username and password, then a one-time password (OTP).
- OTP might be from authentication app or via email/text

Idea is that even if your account details are compromised, attackers can't get in.

Many services still use codes sent via text messages, which are better than nothing but not secure!
