### ðŸ˜ˆ Domain Look-a-likes

Domain names that are meant to look like another domain

<div class="fragment-replacement"><p class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="1">apple.com<br>
appIe.com</p><p class="fragment fade-in" style="font-family: monospace;"data-fragment-index="1">app<strong>l</strong>e.com<br>app<strong>I</strong>e.com</p></div>

Note:

Imagine if I sent you a phishing email, and the link clicked through to a site that looked *just like* Apple's site, and even looked like it had the right domain?

Look closely: these two domains look the same, but the second one uses an upper-case "I" to look like a lower-case "L".

What if you started getting emails from tim.cook@app-I-e.com? Might you believe them?
