<blockquote class="email">
    <p class="subject">From: The Boss &lt;boss@company.com&gt;<br>Subject: You're fired!</p>
    <p>It's been brought to my attention that you've been stealing from the company and smell bad.</p>

Note:

When I was first learning how to code, I wrote a script that sent this email to a friend of mine.

It showed up in his inbox as being from our boss, because I set the "from" header.
