### Sharing Your Current Location

Knowing where you are (or where you're not)

Note:

It's not only our devices we have to worry about sharing our location.

About a decade ago, sharing your location became really popular. Foursquare/Swarm check-ins would tell people where you were hanging out.

This also meant people knew you weren't home. Sites like Please Rob Me popped up to draw attention to this; if you're posting on Instagram about your vacation, thieves know your home is likely unprotected.

Best advice: don't publicly share details about where you are or upcoming travel plans.
