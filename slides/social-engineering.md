### ðŸ˜ˆ Social engineering

Tricking someone into giving you access

Note:

Phishing can be considered a form of social engineering, which is when you trick someone into revealing private information or granting access to something.

Remember SIM-jacking? We feed the right story to the clerk at the Verizon store and BOOM, we have access to someone else's texts.
