### Encrypted Chat

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Texts, Messenger, et al are generally not encrypted
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> iMessage is a bit better, but Apple can still access it
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Signal: [signal.org](https://signal.org/)

Note:

Text messages are insecure, which we'll talk about shortly. Tools like Messenger can be read by Facebook.

Apple has gone to court to fight against law enforcement in order to protect privacy, but they still could read iMessages if they wanted to.

Best solution is to use a tool like Signal, which is free and offers end-to-end encryption.
