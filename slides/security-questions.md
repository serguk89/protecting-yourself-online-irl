### Security Questions

A dangerous hole in your account security!

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> What's your mother's maiden name?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> What school did you attend for first grade?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> What is the name of your favorite pet?

Note:

Some services will let you set up security questions, either as a way to recover your password or as a second form of verification.

Never answer these truthfully, as this information is easy to find!

* Facebook, public records search
* Determine one or more parents, retrieve historical address, look up school district
* Often mentioned in social media and/or a common name

Instead, generate additional passwords or passphrases
