### ⚠️ Doxxing

Revealing personal information about people

Note:

In recent years, there's been a rise in a practice known as "doxxing", where someone posts personal information about you online.

Not a harmless prank! Even if the information is all publicly available anyway, doxxing is a threatening act.

"Hey, I know who you are and where you live"
