### Private Browsing

Automatically clear history, cookies, etc. when closed

Note:

Most modern browsers offer a private browsing mode, where all of the history, cookies, cache, etc. are cleared as soon as you close the browser window.

Great if you're using a shared machine, like at school or the library. Ensures you don't accidentally stay logged into an account or leave tracks in the browser history.
