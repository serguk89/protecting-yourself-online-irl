Note:

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the standard protocol of the web; how we communicate and transmit data.

HTTPS adds Secure Sockets Layer, encrypting the communication between the server and client.

Just because someone has an SSL certificate, that doesn't mean that they're not doing bad things.
