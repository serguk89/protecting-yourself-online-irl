### Check Your Location Privacy

<dl>
    <dt>iOS</dt>
    <dd>Settings &rsaquo; Privacy &rsaquo; Location Services</dd>
    <dt>Android</dt>
    <dd>Settings &rsaquo; Location</dd>
</dl>

Note:

Both iOS and Android should let you grant or deny access to your location on an app-by-app basis. Letting your Maps app know where you are makes sense, but why would a calculator ever need to know this?
