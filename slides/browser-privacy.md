Note:

Just like search engines, your browser may have ulterior motives.

Most of the major browsers are run by companies that make money through advertising. Chrome, Edge, and Safari are run by Google, Microsoft, and Apple, respectively.

Some of these browsers even let you log into the browser, meaning all of your history is tracked through the browser provider's servers.

Mozilla, the non-profit foundation behind the Firefox browser, puts a high value on privacy and is generally leading the charge against tracking scripts.
