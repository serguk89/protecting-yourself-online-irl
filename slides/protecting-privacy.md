<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> More data == more $$$

Note:

Google, Facebook, and plenty of others make their money through ads. The more they know about you, the more accurately they can target these ads.

This is really valuable to advertisers, so they're willing to pay more to know they're reaching their intended audiences. If you're into Star Wars, they want to know that so they can show you a bunch of Star Wars ads.
