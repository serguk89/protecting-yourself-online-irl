### Wiretaps

![People in the '60s: "I better not say that or the government will wiretap my house!". People today: "Hey wiretap, do you have a recipe for pancakes?"](resources/wiretap-meme.webp) <!-- .element: class="fragment" style="max-width: 60%;" -->

Note:

Traditionally, wiretaps were the tools of spies or governments covertly monitoring people.

Today, we're inviting them into our homes in the form of personal assistants, video game consoles, and even thermostats.

Try to avoid these devices, or at least turn off active listening (require a button press to turn the mic on).
