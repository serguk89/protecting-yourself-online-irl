Note:

We're living in an age where there are cameras everywhere. On our computers, phones, tablets, and even on our front doors.

Some of these are brought into our most private spaces — phones and tablets in bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. Cover the camera lenses when they're not in use, and try to keep them out of private places.

Also, make sure these devices are regularly updated; cheap cameras have a bad reputation of being exploited.
