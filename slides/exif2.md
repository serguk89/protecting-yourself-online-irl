Note:

This is a photo I shot while I was out in Seattle last year (Location might be familiar to Twin Peaks fans).

EXIF data reveals some interesting details: I shot it on my iPhone 6, which was running iOS 12.4.1. I used the back camera, and my phone had been turned on for three days.

If I posted this without stripping meta-data, someone might see that I'm running an older phone, and an older version of iOS. If that version has an exploit, they could use that to attack.

Worse yet, if that photo had GPS data, they might know exactly where I was. This could be my home, a relative's house, or even a secret vacation spot.
