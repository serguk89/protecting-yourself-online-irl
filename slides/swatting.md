### ⚠️ Swatting

Faking an emergency in order to have the police/SWAT show up at someone's door

Note:

The gaming community especially has a reputation for Swatting, where you call law enforcement and make it seem like there's an emergency at someone else's house.

Not only is this illegal, but people have died when SWAT officers thought the people in the house were threats.

ABSOLUTELY never do this!

Online personalities (streamers, YouTubers, etc.) may be able to contact local law enforcement and make them aware you're at higher risk.
