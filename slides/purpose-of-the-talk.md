## Goals

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Safety
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> How to spot a scam
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Protect your privacy

Note:

Three goals for this talk:

1. Safety first, right? How do we keep ourselves safe, both online and in-person?
2. We're going to get in the heads of the bad guys, see how they think, and learn what tricks they have up their sleeves so we don't fall for them.
3. Then, we'll look at other ways to protect our privacy, stop people from tracking us, and keep ourselves protected while in public.
