Stealing your data when you just wanted to charge

Note:

A newer attack vector is known as "juice jacking", where you plug into a so-called "free" charging station, but the owner is stealing data while you're plugged in.

Never trust a public USB port; if you must, be sure to use a "USB Condom/Data Blocker".

Standard USB cables have four pins, two for power and two for data. Data blockers remove those data pins, so no data can be transferred through the cable.
