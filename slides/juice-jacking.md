Note:

A newer attack vector is known as "juice jacking", where you plug into a so-called "free" charging station, but the owner is stealing data while you're plugged in.

Standard USB cables have four pins, two for power and two for data. Devices called "data blockers" literally short-out the two data pins, so no data can be transferred through the cable.
