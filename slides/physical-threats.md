### Physical Threats

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Never leave devices unattended
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Keep valuables close and within sight
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Identify exits, safe people

Note:

When you're out in public, it's important to keep an eye on our belongings. Never leave your devices unattended, *especially* unlocked!

Keep your backpack, purse, or bag nearby where you can keep an eye on it.

If you need to use the restroom (coffee shop, for example) lock your machine, take your phone, and ask someone nearby if they can keep an eye on it for you.

- Still dangerous (what if they're the bad actor?), but better than leaving it abandoned.
- Try to memorize details about the person.
- Phone will let you call police/help and/or use location detection features in case of theft. Also small, the easiest thing to walk off with

Take note entrances and exits, along with who might be able to help if there's trouble (employees)
