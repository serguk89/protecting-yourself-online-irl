### Sharing Passwords

Never share a password in plain-text!

Note:

Sharing a password via plain-text (email, chat, text, etc.) means there's a record of the password just hanging out for anyone with access to see.

If you need to share a password for any reason, take advantage of tools like One-Time Secret, which is kind of like Snapchat for messages; people can only view the encrypted message once, then it's deleted.

You can even password-protect the message so nobody can reveal it without having a password that's only for this message (e.g. send the link via email, message password via text/chat).
